The program must receive a pair of values that represents the
total number of arrays that will be received by the program and
the total number of querries that will be received, respectively.

Next the program is going to receive an array at each line, with
the line begining with the number of elements of the array before
having the values.

Each querry consists of a pair of values that represent the
index of a previously declared array and an index of a value
in it - that the program must print it.
